[FIXED]
* v1.1.3
- showing, updating the wrong and confused day, month, date, year by separating them with selected-* and today-* properties.

* v1.2.0
- disabledDays was not implemented properly with change of startDay.

* 1.2.1
- firstDayOfMonth had negative number after deducting startDay, rendered calendar to not display wrongly.

* 1.2.3
- firstMonth actually starts from 0 instead of 1 which broke _computeTotalDay.

* 1.2.4
- added missing 'Saturday' to be displayed when being selected.

* 1.2.6
- revise the behaviour of _todayDate when no year is selected at 'calendar' page.

* 1.2.16 [CASESTUDY]
- set jv-datepicker-dialog to position: absolute, so that the element to always stay on top of the iron-overlay regardless of being wrapped inside or around a wrapper or other element;
- set height/ width to calc();
- set max-height/ max-width to limit the element;

* 1.2.17
- _shiftDisabledDays method shifted wrongly && solved by computing on a new prop instead of writing back into its original prop;
- _computeWeekdays && _computeDays needed to be executed for every change of values of properties.
- _computeDays produces wrong result.
- disableDays = [8, 1] breaks the code at line 985 caused by this.setAttribute('disable-days', JSON-stringify('invalidArr')) && fixed by checking if it is an Array.
 - removed JSON-stringify('invalidArr');

[KNOWN BUGS]
* v1.1.3
- none.
