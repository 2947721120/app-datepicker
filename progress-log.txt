[FIXED]
* v1.1.3
- showing, updating the wrong and confused day, month, date, year by separating them with selected-* and today-* properties.

* v1.2.0
- disabledDays was not implemented properly with change of startDay.

* 1.2.1
- firstDayOfMonth had negative number after deducting startDay, rendered calendar to not display wrongly.

* 1.2.3
- firstMonth actually starts from 0 instead of 1 which broke _computeTotalDay.

* 1.2.4
- added missing 'Saturday' to be displayed when being selected.

* 1.2.6
- revise the behaviour of _todayDate when no year is selected at 'calendar' page.

* 1.2.16 [CASESTUDY]
- set jv-datepicker-dialog to position: absolute, so that the element to always stay on top of the iron-overlay regardless of being wrapped inside or around a wrapper or other element;
- set height/ width to calc();
- set max-height/ max-width to limit the element;

* 1.2.17
- _shiftDisabledDays method shifted wrongly && solved by computing on a new prop instead of writing back into its original prop;
- _computeWeekdays && _computeDays needed to be executed for every change of values of properties.
- _computeDays produces wrong result.
- disableDays = [8, 1] breaks the code at line 985 caused by this.setAttribute('disable-days', JSON-stringify('invalidArr')) && fixed by checking if it is an Array.
- removed JSON-stringify('invalidArr');

* 1.2.18 [CASESTUDY]
- added _disableCls to ensure that _computeDayStyle to execute whenever disableDays changes in value;
- multiple selected date on the calendar page on more than 1 datepicker element, due to document.querySelector returned the wrong element since more than 1 datepicker element have the same id - solved by pro tip http://goo.gl/pevSdY;

* v1.2.19
- IP4, IP5 display issue (solved by removing a line at css styling dateContainer);
- in jv-datepicker, set min-width for all devices and separate min-width for N7 and above;
- set section's width to 96% which wrapping jv-datepicker in demo needs to resize to fit every content;

* 1.4.2
- fixed for non-selectable days to have cursor: not-allowed via CSS on N7 and above;


* v1.4.6
- added @-moz-document url-prefix() to fix display issue on Mozilla Firefox;
- remove position: absolute on jv-datepicker-dialog to fix position issue of jv-datepicker-dialog on Mozilla Firefox and seemed to have fixed on Google Chrome as well;
- Responsive Mode on Mozilla Firefox does not fit the screen to browser, considered as fixed ATM for the dialog's positioning;

* v1.4.7
- cursor CSS missing on Mozilla Firefox - now setting .day to have cursor: pointer and overrides those .day.is-disabled with cursor: not-allowed;
- override .is-disabled when the day happens to fall on a .is-diabled day, so the .is-today will be more prominent and distinguishable;

- none.

* v1.4.
